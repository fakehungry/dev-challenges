## Overview

![screenshot](ss.PNG)

Hi! My name is Chaikit Ruangsakulpat. Now, I'm learning web development. I've learned many courses online, something like Codecademy, Coursera, etc. However, just learn and don't do anything make you forget everything you learnt. Someone said "Practice make perfect". I don't want to be a perfect guy, but I do really want how to build amazing web with my own.

This practice follow the challenge of devChallanges. I built the project by using HTML and CSS only. I took a lot of time to do hamburger menu with CSS only. Thanks to [Travesy Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZg6UfS5zYg) and [DarkCode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQ6YQ8K5MRw) to gave useful resources on Youtube.

Hope you guys enjoy my journey! If you have any advises, do not hesitate to leave it.
