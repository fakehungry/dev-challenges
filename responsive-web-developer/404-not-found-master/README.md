## Overview

![screenshot](/ss.JPG)

Hi! My name is Chaikit Ruangsakulpat. Now, I'm learning web development. I've learned many courses online, something like Codecademy, Coursera, etc. However, just learn and don't do anything make you forget everything you learnt. Someone said "Practice make perfect". I don't want to be a perfect guy, but I do really want how to build amazing web with my own.

This practice follow the challenge of devChallanges. I built the project by using HTML and CSS only. This project help me to sharpen skills in how to dimension anything in web, how to organize contents, etc.

Hope you guys enjoy my journey! If you have any advises, do not hesitate to leave it.
